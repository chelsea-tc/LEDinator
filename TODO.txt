            - Everyone holds their button down and presses the 
            white button. 
            - The game starts and the ring is a timer.
            - During the timer, the players discuss if they are 
            releasing or not. 
            - When the time is up you either release
            the button or you don't.
                - If you are the only one releasing/holding you 
                drink
                - If everyone releases/holds, everyone drinks
                - If equal amount, no one drinks
